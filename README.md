# Super Luigi World
===================

A Mario "clone" and my first programming project ever! 

Create as my final project in my first programming class in high-school. Boy I've come a long way. As you can see, I must have been graded based how well-commented my code was. Tons of beautiful "features":
 - No timestepping. If Luigi jumps, the world stops, hence the lack of moving platforms.
 - Collision detection is built into the level assets via red pixels which the game checks for after rendering.
 - Yes there is an option to change the background music to techno.
 - and more!
